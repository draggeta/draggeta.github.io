   I recently had to set up a HashiCorp Vault server for a client. Due to the requirements, I got to do some new things with regards to Vault authentication. Some of the stated requirements were:
 Authentication to Vault should be done by using Azure Active Directory Use of Azure AD Application Roles for permissions instead of groups Configure Vault via Terraform  While I&#39;ve done quite a bit with Vault and OAuth 2.</description>

   Last holiday I helped my sister find a new setup for her home office. I wanted her setup to be as simple as possible, while still being reasonably priced. The choice fell on the Lenovo 13S-IWL laptop and Dell U2719DC monitor.
Both the monitor and laptop support USB Type-C (USB-C) DisplayPort (DP) Alternate Mode (Alt Mode) which allows for output/input of a DP signal over USB-C.</description>

    TL;DR: Netscalers have an Integrated Cache feature which can cache files even if not licensed. This is the default AAA cache. The cache can store corrupted or outdated files. The cache can be disabled completely, but The only way I found to clear the cache, even after disabling, is with an HA failover or a reboot.</description>
