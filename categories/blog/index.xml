      <description>I&#39;ve decided to start writing a technical blog for two reasons. Reason one is the fact that I&#39;ve been immensly helped by all the blogs online. They helped me study for certs, learn new things or just gave solutions to problems at work. I hope this blog is able to contribute back and help others on their journey.
Reason two is more personal. I just want to develop my skills and writing information down is a good way to force myself to really dive deep.</description>
